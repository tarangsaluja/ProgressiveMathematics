<h2>Pedagogical Strategies and Experiments</h2>

<div>
    <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
    <p>
        Essays submitted to this page are about strategies and experiments used to teach mathematics. Educators, and other people who teach mathematics, should submit reflections on
        their pedagogical strategies. The top of the submission should contain the following information at the top:
        <ul>
            <li>Age Group</li>
            <li>Where this is taught (school, math club, etc.)</li>
            <li>Student skill level and background knowledge</li>
            <li>Demographics</li>
        </ul>

        It would be advised to include as much detail as possible so that people who read the reflections can think carefully about which elements do and do not pply to their contexts. 
        Submissions should not only present their reflections on the strategies and experiments, but also describe what these strategies and experiments <em>replace</em> in order to demonstrate
        the contribution of these strategies and experiments for other educators. 
    </p>

    <p>
        All articles should include required background knowledge at the top.
