    <h3>Our Purpose</h3>
    <p> 
        In earlier societies, the very same people would study mathematics, physics, medicine, the arts, and literature. Discplines
        were not considered to be separate but rather interrelated and part of the same whole. There was a <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telos">telos</a></em> among academics 
        to pursue knowledge for its own sake, and such a philosophy encouraged a broad and diverse education. Unfortunately, this <em>telos</em> cannot be detached from the deeply aristocratic
        societies in which it emerged. The pursuit of knowledge, education, and a general analysis of the world was a privilege for the wealthy. For instance, while slaves in Ancient Greece would roll the wheels 
        which were used for construction, their masters and elites would explore the wonders of geometry for their own lesiure. The mathematicians of the time, as such, 
        were alienated from the material conditions around them and pursued mathematics in an inordinately formal and abstract manner. 
    </p>

    <p>
        While mathematics education has become marginally more egalitarian in the 21st century, it continues to be wracked by severe
        inequalities. Mathematics also continues to be de-politicized and aleinated from people's material realities. Centuries of understanding
        mathematics as separate from its material context has caused many in the mathematical discpline to scorn practical applications, feteshize complexity and formalism
        while discarding simplicity and intuition, and remove mathematics from its social context. Furthermore, the relentless pursuit of efficiency and profit exacerbates the tendency
        to balkanize the pursuit of knowledge into discrete, differentiated <em>discplines</em> in order to encourage <em>specialization</em> and 
        place greater emphasis on the <em>discplines</em> which align with business interests and the pursuit of profit. While, on the surface, such a strategy
        creates greater efficiency, there is a lot of knowledge which is lost when individual discplines are separated from their broader social, pedagogical, and epistemological contexts. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Mathematics should not be understood without its interrelations with all other pursuits of studies and its broader social context. Mathematics is not just a "pure" science. It is an art, it is a social
        science, it is a literature, and it is a humanities. Inequalities in our society and our failure to understand mathematics more broadly has created a world in which a beautiful subject, a form of art, a liberatory way of thinking,
        has been relegated to a procedural headache for the less privileged and a detached, simultaneously analytical and creative, pursuit for the more privileged. While the less privileged 
        have come to resent mathematics as an obstacle, an undecipherable code, which stands between them and their dreams, the more privileged find themselves using mathematics to, directly or indirecly,
        make vast quantites of money for predatory financial institutions, weapons of death for military defense companies, or surveillence technologies for a supranational policicing apparatus. A lucky few
        are able to study mathematics for some superposition of clout and self-indulegence, a situation which is subpar in its own way. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The trouble with <em>interdiscplinary studies</em> is that our studies were never meant to be <em>separate discplines</em>. There are many ways in which we <em>organize</em> our social realities, and 
        the way we have done it now serves the interests of the most powerful in society. We could organize our studies in terms of <em>problems</em> to solve, or we could organize our studies by periods 
        of history. If we democratize our studies, then we may be to develop a <em>method</em> for how we democratize our studies in order to serve the popular interests. While the current systems in which we 
        exist make this difficult, we must prefigure the future which we wish to create from that very angle. 
    </p>

    <p>
        This crowd-sourced website is for anyone, but especially mathematics educators, who want to re-imagine a more progressive mathematics which brings out the beauty, science, soscial science, and
        humanities in mathematics. The goal is to re-contestualize mathematics as an activity for human flourishing, whether by its practical applications or its beauty. The position which mathematics 
        currently occupies, one of "purity" and "elitism," makes this difficult, even borderline impossible, to imagine. But we must create practices, pedagogies, and ways of knowing in which 
        mathematics becomes a tool for the people, a form of leisure and play, and a study which is understood through the world within which it exists.

    <h3>Submissions</h3>
    <p>
        All sections of this website take submissions from readers. Each page has a blurb on top which describes the requirements for submission and the email to which you can submit your essay. 
        Essays which build upon previous essays, or challenge previous essays, are especially encouraged. Submissions will be reviewed by the editorial board chosen by the creators of this project at 
        first. However, as the number of subscribers and active contributors increases, we will try to democratize the selection of the editorial board.
